# Haar Cascade Classifier Using OpenCV:
* This repository demonstrates the implementation of Haar Cascade Classifiers for object detection using OpenCV, a popular open-source computer vision library.
* Haar Cascade Classifiers are widely used for object detection, particularly for tasks such as face detection, eye detection, and pedestrian detection.

## What is Haar Cascade Classifier?
* Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based object detection technique used to identify objects in images or video streams. 
* It works by training a classifier based on positive and negative images, using Haar features and a cascade of classifiers that progressively refine the detection process. 
* This approach is computationally efficient and fast, making it suitable for real-time applications.
* The classifier uses a series of stages where each stage consists of a set of Haar features. These features are used to create weak classifiers that are combined to form a stronger classifier.

## Key Features:
* Real-Time Object Detection: Detects objects such as faces, eyes, and other objects in real-time video or static images.
* Fast and Efficient: Utilizes the Haar feature-based cascade classifier which is efficient for real-time applications.
* OpenCV Integration: Seamless integration with OpenCV for easy implementation, training, and inference.
* Pretrained Models: Includes pretrained Haar Cascade models for face, eye, and other common object detection tasks.
* Supports Multiple Object Detection: Custom classifiers can be trained for detecting any type of object using Haar Cascade.

## Requirements:
* To run this project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

    * Python 3.x
    * OpenCV
    * Numpy
